# CrazySpace-Game
This is a copy of a game, which I created in school.

## Description
The goal of the game is to drive with an ambulance over worms in the space.
The bigger the worms are, the more your score increases. But be aware of the ladybugs!
There is a eighty percent chance that they are dangerous and eat your vehicle.
Therefore, you are equipped with ballistic rockets.
